# About me

Long story short : I'm a 1999 born IT / Science / History enthusiast who also happens to be a student willing to share a few of his experiences in a more wrote out way. 

Well, it's more about documenting the stuff I'm doing rather than actually sharing it people. Not that I would mind the latter, though.
The idea is to be able to, one day, get back to all the projects I've worked on and being able to rewind the tape and revisit the past.
In a more utilitarian manner, I'm also looking to revisit and maintain and / or upgrade projects I've done in the past without struggling to remember what I did and how I did it. 

As for myself, I got into the IT world at around 14 playing... Minecraft. I spent roughly 4 years playing the game on various (yet not really numerous) servers and communities, over the course of which I gradually climbed the steps, be it in game or out game. I think I owe my taste and curiosity for IT to a benevolent SSE who kind of took me under wing as I was progressively getting involved into web developpement, system administration, etc. 

Nowadays, I'm interested in various fields of IT, ranging from plain developpement to security, and including good old home projects as well as graph theory and algorithmics. 
I'm otherwise quite hooked on science and engineering, especially theoritical domains such as mathematics and physics. 

I have also recently grown an interest to military history and strategy, and later history in general, as I got of out of secondary school, which evolved into a compulsive consumption on books and videos on the matter. 
Philosophy hasn't been my cup of tea for quite a long time, as I, by principle, despise the way it is taught. Sharpening critical thinking and in general reflexive abilities shouldn't rhyme with "learn absurd amounts of information by heart to ace an exam". For the record, I didn't quite ace the exam. I however like to formulate and write down my reflexions and opinions or various subjects.

And last but not least, music plays an important role in my life, as I always was a great consumer and often hanged out with musicians, without playing myself... Until a few years back, when I bought an old keyboard and starting (sporadically) playing.

# The name
You may also ask where does this seemingly weird name comes from. 
The answer comes from ancien Greek, and especially the word "ἐπιστήμη", which relates to the notions of knowledge or truth.
Naming myself "knowledge" probably gives away a dazzling impression of self importance, but this choice is rather related to the fact I grant a lot of importance to the first and have very precise ideas on the latter. The A and M are also my initials in real life, and I figured I would add them as it sounds just fine.
