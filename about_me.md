# About me

Long story short : I'm a 1999 born IT / Science / History enthusiast who also happens to be a student willing to share a few of his experiences in a wrote out way. 

Well, it's more about documenting the stuff I'm doing rather than actually sharing it people. Not that I would mind the latter, though.
The idea is to be able to, one day, get back to all the projects I've worked on and being able to rewind the tape and revisit the past.
In a more utilitarian manner, I'm also looking to revisit and maintain and / or upgrade projects I've done in the past without struggling to remember what I did and how I did it.
