# Mechanical Keyboard Madness : "State of the Art" (WiP)
###### 11/11/2019

## Context and needs 
And one new project piling up on the list ! It stems from a fairly simple problem : I've grown quite used to my laptop keyboard, however I do have a
full-size computer too, and the keyboard that goes along with it. My desk is not the largest nor the widest, and I'd like to have some wiggle room,
plus I've noticed virtually a third of my full size keyboard isn't used much if at all. The said fullsize keyboard was also bought years ago, and
I didn't put any specific attention to the quality of the typing experience into it. I figured maybe it was time for a bit of a change. 

The gist of what I just wrote is that I'm looking for a keyboard : 
- with a small form factor that doesn't take up half my desk
- the best typing experience available for the lowest price
- all of that with a ~100-150€ budget.

The typing experience thing seems to suggest one thing : mechanical keyboards. And this is indeed the path I am choosing here. Now, a few factors have
to be taken into account before choosing a keyboard, and I'll try to go over them somewhat comprehensively.

Also, as always in the tech world, there are two paths : 
- the OEM route, buying a pre-made keyboard that suits all your needs (more realistically, a fraction of your needs you consider good enough to end up
  buying one)
- the DIY route : buying the individual components and manufacturing the keyboard yourself. Though this ensures your needs will be fulfilled, this
  also means investing time and effort into a final product whose quality is only restricted by your own ability. 

## The keyboard layout
So this seems like a basic, but it's pretty important to choose. This will determine the size factor of the keyboard, but also needs to be chosen
accordingly with regards to what you need and what keys you think is necessary. 

There are a few well-known layouts, but depending on their rarity, you might have to take the DIY route in order do achieve what you really want : 
- the full-size keyboard : basically your standard desktop keyboard, with a keypad and all. Practical, yet bulky ;
- the tenkeyless / 80% keyboard : basically your standard non-18" laptop keyboard with added keys (the ones usually between the keypad and the alphanumeric
  "block"). Basically a standard keyboard without a keypad ;
- the 75% keyboard : now the lines get a little blurry, but this one is about removing the "middle block" of keys and partially integrating it to the
  left side of the keyboard to have one single keys block and no unused space. The "blurry" part is because while most of them have an additionnal row
  of keys left of the enter key (PageUp, PageDown, ...), some don't, but are still considered 75% keyboards ;
- the 60 / 65% keyboard : this is where things start to get minimalist. The Fn row disappears, and you instead use your single Fn key as a selector to
  use the number keys. 65% keyboards have arrows. 60% don't.

This classification is something you can find quite easily with a bit of research, so I'm not going to bother going more in depth. Besides, 40% and
lower are (it's my opinion), despite being stylish, not very suited to the kind of computing I'm doing on the regular. 

So, this seems somewhat simple... Or is it ? 

Well, yes, but actually no. Most layouts here have standard versions, but every so often, you encounter a slight non-standard variation. And even
within standard versions, there are two big groups : ISO keyboards and ANSI keyboards. 

Usually, ANSI keyboards are the most prevalent (relying upon a North American standard), which ISO keyboards are more prevalent in Europe and slightly
less prevalent outside of it. What is the difference you may ask ? Well, an ISO keyboard has these pretty noticeable weirdly shaped two units-high
enter keys. There are a few other differences, but that's the main one. 

Also, keycap sizes are usually determined in "units", which is the size of a standard letter key. Ctrl and Alt keys are typically usually 1.25u keys. 

So, what do I do in all this ? Well, I was lucky enough to stumble upon a picture of a custom-made 75% ISO layout, which seems to be exactly what I
need. 

TODO 75% KEEB : WIKI OR THE VERGE

Why ? Well, most of the keys of a tenkeyless are accessible one way on another, but it retains the compactness of smaller keyboards, which I also
quite like. I also had the chance to test a friends 75% keyboard, and I could verify I didn't feel restrained by the number of keys (or lack
thereof).

Why the ISO layout ? Well, simply because I'm more used to it, honestly. With the ANSI keyboard I tried, I was making quite a few mistakes with the
specific keys that are missing / moved, and I can see that happening quite a bit in the future if I move on to this layout. 75% is however not a very
used keyboard layout, so I'd guess going ISO would make it slightly hard to find keycaps and plates for it. 

## The switches
The switches are arguably the most important part of the keyboard. Why ? Well, their quality directly influences your typing experience. There are,
obviously, a lot of different switches on the market, trying to accomodate every user's needs. The most famous brand is Cherry and their age-old
mechanical keyboard switches. There are, however, a whole lot of different other brands with different characteristics (or just simple lesser quality
clones of the Cherry switches). 

Apart from the brand, there are different types of switch too, depending on their reaction to a keystroke : 
- linear switches consist in having a smooth spring attached to a keycap and... that's all. Okay, that may be more complicated than this, but the idea
  is that the switches' response is going to be in a linear relationship with the key's position ;
- tactile switches are different in that they provide a tactile "bump" whenever the keystroke registers, thus noticing the user he doesn't need to
  push further down and lose time on his typing spree. These are well liked by typists in general. This bump however means the force the user needs to
  apply won't be linear, since it needs to be a bit higher before the bump to overcome it ;
- "clicky" switches are usually tactile too, but they also provide a "click" sound whenever a keystroke is registered. 

## The plate
While not strictly necessary the plate is a bit of a backbone : it is supposed to hold the switches in place. The concurrent approach is to attach the
switches directly to the underlying PCB, which in some cases causes the keyboard to feel wobbly, because a PCB is obviously more flexible than a 1.5mm
stainless steel plate. 

Now yet again, to options here : 
- buying an OEM plate that HAS to fit your layout 
- making it yourself. 

The DIY option comes with a few problems though : at some point, you will have to make square holes. Which your standard CNC milling machine can't
really do (the milling bit being cylindrical and all...). There is a tolerance however, and these corners have to be no more than a certain diameter. 
The alternative option, if you can afford it / have access to it, is using a water jet / laser cutting machine.
