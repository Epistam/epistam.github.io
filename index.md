# Welcome !

So there you are. 
Perhaps the most appropriate way to greet you here is to actually summarize what's going here.
Well, the description isn't really lying about that, as this place is not much more than an eclectic collection of texts, blogposts and other stuff your servant has written in a moment of distraction.
It doesn't really serve any purpose apart from entertaining myself and perhaps -let's hope for the best- you.

I shall then wish you a pleasant and enjoyable stay here, and don't hesitate to contact me with the help of the dedicated page.
Have a nice day !
