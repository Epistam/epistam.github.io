# Welcome !

So there you are. 
Perhaps the most appropriate way to greet you is to actually summarize what's going here.
Well, the description isn't really lying about that, as this place is not much more than an eclectic collection of texts, blogposts and other stuff your servant has written in a moment of distraction, mostly about my points of interests.
It ranges from Science and IT to the dark corners of History, Politics and perhaps Military Strategy.
It doesn't really serve any purpose apart from entertaining myself and perhaps -let's hope for the best- you.
Well, allowing me to write down my thoughts in an intelligible way -for once- is also a concern, I have to say.

I shall then wish you a pleasant and enjoyable stay, all the while feeling free to contact me or take a peek at the About Me page.
Have a nice day !
