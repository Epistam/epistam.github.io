# A look back on my astronophotography shenanigans
###### 30/03/2022

A long, long time ago (no, really, it must have been 8 years since I layed a
hand on my telescope), I used to have enough time off to have multiple hobbies,
and one of these was astronomy. Now, I've always been interested in the vast
confines of space, be it the underlying mechanics of it, or, perhaps more
importantly for this post, in its looks.

Looking at beautiful things is nice... But isn't it better to record that experience ? 
To share and discuss it afterwards, or even to relive fond memories in your old days ?
And thus was born my passion for astrophotography.

# How it worked
As one must know, astronomy is an expensive hobby. High grade optics, precision
equatorial mounts, all this equipment costs a hefty amount of money. I was
lucky enough to be gifted all that one lucky birthday, but astrophotography has
one more requirement : a camera. 

Usually, specialized cameras would have a CCD sensor, an adapted mounting
system for the focuser, perhaps a cooling system to reduce the sensor noise...
With a pricetag around 500 euros at least.

Then, there was the "other" way around. A few webcams (namely, Phillips'
SPC900NC and Sony's Vesta Pro --adequately named, I must say--) actually used
CCD sensors. 

Now, one had to find a way to attach it to the telescope. Back in the day,
argentic photography was also still a thing... or at least, had been enough of
a thing in the past decade that I could find film roll boxes littering the
house. What I didn't know at the time is that it was actually a pretty accepted
trick of the trade that these actually were 31.75mm (1.25") in diameter, and
thus fitting perfectly on the telescope. 

Unscrew the lense, drill a hole in the case top, screw the lens back to attach
the webcam to the top of the case... There, done !

# What it looked like

## Jupiter
Jupiter was a prime target. During opposition periods, it presents a large
bright target, with a decent amount of details, and most notably its infamous
red spot (which I was lucky enough to miss everytime).

# What next ? 
Some day, when I have time, might come back to it more pics and all
touch on the basics of guidance / equatorial mounts and photo treatment
